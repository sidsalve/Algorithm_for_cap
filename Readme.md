4.Algorithms using Python
	This algorithm to solve the given cap problem 
	This algorithm gives the minimum number of flips of caps
	algorithm gives minimum number of commands

	here 
		f-forward
		b-backward
		n-no cap 
	in this program we are trying to ignore no caps people and flip caps using minimum commands
	--How To run

		$python3 algorithm.py <number>
			here number is any number means that numbers of people wearing caps
	--To generate output file
		$python3 algorithm.py 13 > output_file
